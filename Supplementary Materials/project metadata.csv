Dates of data collection:,,,,,
The data was collected over a period of 9 years (from 2011-2020). ,,,,,
Data collection methods:,,,,,
"Samples were collected daily over the above specified time period. An automated sampling device was used to collect 24 composite samples for each hour of the day. Samples were collected between 8am-10am the following day and combined to create a representative 24-h composite sample. The concentrations of target residues (in nanograms/litre) were obtained through off and on-line solid phase extraction with polymeric cartridges, and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The drug use for each city was then estimated by multiplying the concentration of each target drug reside with the corresponding flow of sewage (litre/day) and a correction factor (obtained by considering the average excretion rate of a given drug residue and the molecular mass ratio of the parent drug/metabolite) and then dividing by the population served by the wastewater treatment plant. The resulting number represents the amount of substance consumed per day per 1000 people.  Averages of substance consumption were found for the entire week, all weekdays, and the weekend for every year of the study. ",,,,,
Ethical Statement:,,,,,
Guidelines outlining the main ethical risks for wastewater research and strategies on how to mitigate these risks can be found here: https://score-cost.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2016/11/WBE-ethical-guidelines-FINAL-March-2016-.pdf,,,,,
Preparing the data:,,,,,
"For the purpose of our study, only Countries for which drug metabolite data was available in 6 or more cities were included. This encompossed 8 countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, and Slovenia) and 90 cities. Additionally, the time period was narrowed down to 2011-2018.",,,,,
"To ensure more even comparisons, this study followed a blocking design where 5 cities were randomly selected from each of the 8 remaining countries.",,,,,
"To randomly select 5 cities from each country, first a sampling frame was constructed in excel where each of the 90 cities were numbered and paired with their corresponding country. This sampling frame was input into R studio (with the read.csv() function) in order to create a series of subsamples for each country. To create the subsamples, the function sample() was used with the arguments x (the range of numbers of the cities in the country of interest), size (how many cities should be in each subsample), and replace (can the same city be selected twice). ",,,,,
"To get the total sample population for our study, we then used the rbind() function to join together the newly created subsamples. The data frame containing the total sample population was then exported as a .csv file using the write.csv() function so that it could be combined with the drug metabolite data for each randomly selected city and used in downstream analysis. ",,,,,
"For ease of analysis, only the weekday mean of drug use was considered. ",,,,,

GDP Data ,,,,,
,,,,,
Intent of the data:,,,,,
To determine the gross domestic product (GDP) of 266 countries/regions around the world. ,,,,,
GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.,,,,,
Please see the World Bank website for more information on the limitations of using GDP in data analysis.,,,,,
Data type:,,,,,
This dataset takes the form of categorical data. ,,,,,
Data acquisition:,,,,,
The raw data set was accessed The World Bank website (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) ,,,,,
Study site(s):,,,,,
The study sites in this data set are comprised of 266 different countries/regions around the world. Please see https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD&country= for a complete list. ,,,,,
Dates of data collection:,,,,,
The data was collected yearly for a period of 80 years (from 1960-2020). ,,,,,
Data collection methods:,,,,,
"This dataset was based on World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files. Data collection methods include: population censuses, household surveys, national accounts, purchasing power parity surveys, income surveys, and agricultural censuses.",,,,,
"Country data is collected in the local currency units, and then converted to the constant price of the base year as determined by each country. For GDP, these values are then converted into constant 2010 USD with gap filling of missing values. Missing data are imputed based on the relationship of the sum of available data to the total in the year of the previous estimate",,,,,
